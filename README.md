### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
### I'm Christian.

I'm currently part of London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE) Data Analytics Career Accelerator 
programme and continuously working on improving my analytical skills, using Excel, SQL, Python and R. As I have
ten years of prior experience in running my own company in the F&B industry, my main focus is how to improve
decision-making in companies by leveraging a single source of truth approach.

This profile is regularly updated and will soon be showing more interesting projects! ðŸ™‚
